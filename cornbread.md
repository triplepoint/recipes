## Ingredients
_Note that the measures below give volume in customary units and mass in metric units.  Don't get confused._
- 1 1/2 cups or 205 g     cornmeal, preferably stone ground
- 1 1/4 cups or 283 g     milk
- 1 cup      or 135 g     all purpose flour
- 1 Tb       or 7 g       baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp. or 7 g       kosher salt (or 1 tsp/ 1/4 oz regular salt)
- 1/2 c      or 106 g     vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs

## Procedure
- Place a skillet on an oven rack and preheat to 450 degrees.
- In a large bowl, soak the cornmeal in the milk for 15 minutes.
- Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
- After the cornmeal has soaked, add the eggs and vegetable oil to the cornmeal mixture and beat/stir to combine well.
- Pour the cornmeal mixture over the flour mixture and stir to incorporate, taking care not to overmix.
- Using an oven mitt, remove the skillet from the hot oven, grease with butter, and pour in the batter.  Bake about 25 minutes or until the cornbread is golden brown.
- Remove the skillet from the oven, invert the cornbread onto a serving plate and then flip again onto a cutting board.  Slice the cake of cornbread into 8 wedges and return it to the plate.

## Notes
Use the smaller 8" skillet, or else double the recipe for the larger 12" skillet
