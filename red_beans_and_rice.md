# George's Red Beans and Rice Recipe

# Red Beans and Rice
## Ingredients
- 1 lb red beans (the bag of dried beans)
- vegetable oil
- 2-3 yellow onions, chopped
- 4-5 stalks celery, chopped
- 1-2 bell peppers, chopped
- 1 bunch green onion bottoms, chopped

- 1 lb smoked sausage or tasso
- 2-3 bay leaves
- 0.5 tsp chili powder
- 0.25 tsp cumin
- 0.5 tsp cayenne (or to taste)
- 0.5 tsp black pepper
- Tabasco to taste
- Salt to taste
- 2 Tbsp parsley
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

- Chicken broth
- White rice

- 1 bunch green onions tops, chopped

# Procedure
- Wash beans and soak 2-3 hours in just enough water to cover.  Drain water.  The longer you soak, the less time you need to simmer the beans.  I cook for a long time, so a 2-3 hour soak is plenty.
- Sweat onions, celery, bell pepper, and green onion bottoms in a small amount of oil.
- When onions are clear, add the beans, meat, garlic, and seasonings.
- Add chicken broth/water to cover and bring to a boil.
- Once boiling, reduce heat and simmer for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally.  Add spices to taste.  Keep the liquid level up.
- Serve over hot rice, with onion tops.  Good with cornbread.

# Notes
(4-6 servings or so.  i usually double the recipe and freeze some)
