## Ingredients
_Note that the measures below give both volume and weight units.  The 'oz' are dry ounces.  Don't get confused._
- 1 1/2 cups or 7 1/4 oz. cornmeal, preferably stone ground
- 1 1/4 cups or 10 oz     milk
- 1 cup      or 4 3/4 oz. all purpose flour
- 1 Tb       or 1/4 oz.   baking powder
- 1 1/2 tsp. or 1/4 oz.   kosher salt (or 1 tsp/ 1/4 oz regular salt)
- 1/2 c      or 3 3/4 oz. vegetable oil
- 2 large eggs

## Procedure
- Place a skillet on an oven rack and preheat to 450 degrees.
- In a large bowl, soak the cornmeal in the milk for 15 minutes.
- Mix together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
- After the cornmeal has soaked, add the eggs and vegetable oil to the cornmeal mixture and beat/stir to combine well.
- Pour the cornmeal mixture over the flour mixture and stir to incorporate, taking care not to overmix.
- Using an oven mitt, remove the skillet from the hot oven, grease with butter, and pour in the batter.  Bake about 25 minutes or until the cornbread is golden brown.
- Remove the skillet from the oven, invert the cornbread onto a serving plate and then flip again onto a cutting board.  Slice the cake of cornbread into 8 wedges and return it to the plate.

## Notes
Use the smaller 8" skillet, or else double the recipe for the larger 12" skillet
