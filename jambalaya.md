# George's Jambalaya Recipe

# Ingredients
- 2 lbs andouille (or just smoked sausage), halved and sliced (half moons)
- 2 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 1" 'cubes'
- 2 lbs boneless/skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1" 'cubes'
- 4-5 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs

- Vegetable Oil
- 5-6 Yellow Onions, chopped
- 3-4 Bell peppers, chopped
- 5 Stalks celery, chopped
- 1 bunch green onion bottoms (white part), chopped
- 2 tsp salt

- 5-6 cloves garlic, minced

- 1 tbsp Black Pepper
- cayenne pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp dried thyme leaves
- 4-5 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp Tabasco
- 2 tbsp Lea and Perrins (worchestershire)
- 2 cans chicken broth
- 4 cups extra long grain rice

- 1 bunch green onion tops, chopped

# Procedure
- In a cast iron dutch oven, brown sausage.  when brown, remove to a bowl
- Brown pork.   when brown, remove to the meat bowl
- brown chicken (including optional thighs).  when brown, remove to meat bowl
- Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and green onion bottoms along with an appropriate amount of oil and sweat.  add a few pinches of salt at this step, as appropriate.
- When the onions are "clear", add the garlic and let cook for a few minutes.
- Add the browned meats, spices, tabasco, lea and perrins, and enough chicken broth to cover.  Stir and bring to a boil.
- Reduce heat and let simmer.  duration is up to you - just remember to add water and/or broth every so often to keep the liquid level higher than the meats and veggies.  Usual length of time is a couple of hours, but its not unheard of to simmer for 5-6 hours.  Just keep the liquid level up. Taste every so often and add spices to taste.  I recommend chili powder.  If you notice pools of oil/grease on top, skim the oil off the top and toss it.
- About 45 mins prior to serving time, add your rice.  This is a REALLY inexact science for me.  Just add an "appropriate" amount of rice.  If you've got a big pot, usually enough rice to keep the liquid level .5-1 inch above the top.  Bring back to a boil.
- Once boiling, cut heat to as low as you can get it and cover.  let it go for 20 mins or so, remove lid and give a really good stir, scraping the bottom in the process.  You'll know now if you need more rice or more liquid.  Add whats needed, if needed.  If you added rice or liquid, bring back to a boil.
- If you didn't add anything, or if you did and brought it back to a boil, kill the heat and put the lid back on.  let it sit for 20-30 mins.
- open the pot back up and taste.  should be good to go.  At thins point it's probably worth picking out the chicken bones and bay leaves.
- serve with some chopped green onion tops.  also good is a side of white beans or field peas.

# Notes, from several different tries
- Estimates are it feeds about 12 people?
- Two big boxes of stock worked well this time, with a couple pitchers of water to round it out
- Boiled something like 2 hours and change, after the boil and before the rice went in
- Skimmed most of the oil, worked fine
- put in 6 dry cups of rice this last time.  Looked ok.
